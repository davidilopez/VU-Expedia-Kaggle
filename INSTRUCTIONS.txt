To test on Kaggle:
1. Install the packages with the script "PACKAGE_INSTALL_SCRIPT.R" (just open it
and click on source).
2. Run the "MASTER_SCRIPT_KAGGLE_EVAL.R"
3. Take the output file and upload it to the Kaggle competition.
4. If the results are better than the baseline, go to the final model, if not,
try modifying the parameters in the modelling part (number of trees, max depth,
number of folds, etc.)

To run the final model:
1. Run the "MASTER_SCRIPT_MODELLING.R" with the successful parameters found in
the previous step.
2. Take the output file, name it "080.csv" and we can send it to Mark.
